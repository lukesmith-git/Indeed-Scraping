# Indeed-Scraping
## The Spider
I modified and used the spider found on the github page for [ian-kerins]("https://github.com/python-scrapy-playbook/indeed-python-scrapy-scraper/blob/master/README.md").
I look to scrape indeed to find information about salaries, post ages, and required languages for data scientist and data analyst positions. I limited results to Remote jobs, which can be changed in the keyword section of the spider.
## The Rest
The remaining code can be optimized, but as I was only doing a passthrough once and on a relatively small dataset, the rough and ready code for cleaning worked fine.
For visualization I used matplotlib and seaborn. Everything else was covered by pandas.
